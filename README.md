Mecca Analytics is a Data Analytics service that helps turn low performing public schools into high performing schools. Our service is meant to bridge the gap by taking public data, organizing it, and creating a comparison to show which schools perform better. We then offer detailed learning plans so the school knows which areas they are lacking in specifically and how they can improve.
